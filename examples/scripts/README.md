# Utilizing pyJiraCli with Python Subprocess

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the `pyJiraCli` tool within Python scripts to automate Jira-related tasks by leveraging the `subprocess` module. \
The `subprocess` module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.

## Using Subprocess to Call pyJiraCli

To use `pyJiraCli` within a Python script, you can use the `subprocess` module to run commands. Here is a general structure on how to do this:

1. **Construct the Command:** Create the command string as you would run it in the terminal.
2. **Run the Command:** Use `subprocess.run` to execute the command.
3. **Handle Output and Errors:** Check the return code and handle any output or errors.

### Example Structure

```python
import subprocess

# Construct the command
command = f'pyJiraCli --profile my_jira_profile get_sprints "YOUR_BOARD_NAME" --file output.json'

# Run the command
result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=False)

# Handle output and errors
if result.returncode == 0:
    print("Command executed successfully!")
    # Process the output file as needed
else:
    print(f"Command failed with return code {result.returncode}")
    # Handle the error appropriately
```

## Error Handling

It is crucial to handle errors gracefully when using `subprocess` to call `pyJiraCli`. Always check the return code of the `subprocess.run` command and handle any non-zero return codes appropriately.

```python
if result.returncode != 0:
    print(f"Command failed with return code {result.returncode}")
    # Additional error handling code here
```

## Conclusion

By integrating `pyJiraCli` into your Python scripts using the `subprocess` module, you can automate and streamline your Jira workflows. This guide provides a basic structure for running `pyJiraCli` commands within Python scripts. Modify this structure to fit your specific requirements and enhance your Jira management processes.
